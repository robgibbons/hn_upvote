# hn_upvote
A Userscript to automatically upvote downvoted comments on Hacker News

Many useful comments on HN are downvoted without reason, or otherwise petty reasons. This userscript automatically upvotes any downvoted/grayed-out comments to counteract this phenomenon. 

To the best of my knowledge this script does not violate the rules of Hacker News (see https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html, https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html) 

This script is provided only for educational purposes. Use at your own risk.
